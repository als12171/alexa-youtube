# alexa-youtube-skill

This project contains the source code for an unpublished skill that allows users to search and play audio from YouTube
as, by default, Amazon Alexa does not support playing audio from YouTube.

After setting this skill up, it's easy to query YouTube for the video of your choice:

> Alexa, ask YouTube to search for ... 

This skill performs a search, finding the most relevant video that matches the query. 
It then streams the video (audio only) to your Alexa device for your enjoyment. :)
